Parallel Quicksort Algorithms is a comparative study that aims to explore and analyze various parallel Quick Sort algorithms and their implementations. The project covers the fundamentals of parallel programming and Quick Sort, followed by a comprehensive literature review of existing parallel Quick Sort algorithms.

The study focuses on three main approaches to parallelizing Quick Sort: Parallel Programming Libraries/APIs, Parallel Sorting Algorithms, and a Combination of Sequential and Parallel Approaches. The project also includes an analysis of the algorithms, covering time and space complexity, scalability, and load balancing.

The main goal of the project is to gain a deeper understanding of parallel Quick Sort algorithms, evaluate their performance, and determine their suitability for different use cases.
